## How to follow this workshop

- Workshop materials are available at the following [link](https://github.com/)

- Prerequisites: 

  - Basic proficiency in R
  - Some basic knowledge about different R data types &amp; structures (character, numeric, data frame, etc.) 

- Possibility to communicate with Teacher Assistants for relevant questions about our training session

---

## Learning goals 🚀

- Get a clear understanding of the ggplot2 R package and some of its extensions: ggprism, and GGally

--

- Design effective data visualization by choosing the appropriate ggplot2 geoms when selecting the data

--

- Make some visualization enhancements using professional plots

---

## What is the grammar of graphics?

- Google defines a **grammar** as “the whole system and structure of a language or of languages in general, usually taken as consisting of syntax and morphology (including inflections) and sometimes also phonology and semantics.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 

--

- Others consider a **grammar** to be “the fundamental principles or rules of an art or science.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 

--

- Applied to visualizations, a **grammar of graphics** is a grammar used to describe and create a wide range of statistical graphics.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 

--

- The **layered grammar of graphics** approach is implemented in &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color='#2166ac'&gt;ggplot2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a widely used graphics library for R. All graphics in this library are built using a layered approach, building layers up to create the final graphic.

--

- The &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color='#2166ac'&gt;ggplot2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is an abbreviation of **grammar of graphics plot**. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;font color='#2166ac'&gt;ggplot2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is created by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/).

--

- Hadley Wickham wrote a very interesting book [*ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387981403/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=ggplot2-20) that shows you how to use ggplot2 to create graphics that help you understand your data.

## The components of graphics using ggplot2

**- Data:** is what we want to visualize. Data should be in a `data.frame` format to be used in ggplot2.

**- Coordinate system (coord):** A coord describes how data coordinates are mapped to the plane of the graphics. We normally use Cartesian coordinates (default), but a number of others are available, including polar coordinates and map projections.

**- Geoms:** The geoms are the geometric objects that are drawn to represent the data such as points, lines, areas, polygons, etc.

**- Aesthetics:** Aesthetics are visual properties of geoms such as x and y positions, colors, shapes, transparency, etc.

**- Scales:** Scales map values in the data space to values in the aesthetic space whether it is color, size, or shape.

**- Statistical transformation (stats):** The stats summarize data in many useful ways. Examples binning and counting to create a histogram and regression line for regression analysis.

## Overview of the **peopleanalyticsdata** R package

Data sets for statistical inference modeling related to People Analytics.
Contains eleven data sets from the book [**'Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics'**](http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/) by [Keith McNulty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/) (2020).


```r
library(peopleanalyticsdata)

## Boxplot

&gt; A **boxplot** aims to study the distribution. It can also show the distribution within multiple groups, along with the median, range, and outliers. 

&gt; The dark line inside the box represents the median. The top of box is 75% percentile and bottom of box is 25% percentile.

&gt; The end points of the lines (a.k.a whiskers) is at a distance of 1.5*IQR, where IQR or Inter Quartile Range is the distance between 25th and 75th percentiles. The points outside the whiskers are marked as dots and are normally considered as extreme points.

### **`geom_boxplot()`**

- Requires to specify the data `data()`.
- Requires the `x` and `y` aesthetic inside `aes()` while plotting one numeric and one categorical data visualization.
- Can change appearance of the boxes with `color`, `fill`, `alpha` arguments.

## Barplot

&gt; A **barplot** displays the relationship between a numeric and a categorical variable. 

&gt; A type of graph in which different amounts that are being compared are shown using rectangles that have different lengths but the same width.

### **`geom_bar()`**

- Requires to specify data `data()`.
- Provides both x and y inside `aes()` where, x is either character or factor and y is numeric.
- Specifies width of bars with the `bins` or `binwidth` argument
- Sets `stat=identity` to make a bar chart create bars instead of a histogram.
- Can change appearance of the bars with `color`, `fill`, `alpha` arguments.

## Density Histogram
 we attempt to visualize the underlying probability distribution of the data by drawing an appropriate continuous curve.

### **`geom_histogram()`**

&gt; A **histogram** corresponds to a set of filled rectangles whose heights correspond to the counts and whose widths correspond to the width of the variable bins. 

&gt; In a **density** plot,
- Requires to specify data `data()`.
- Requires the `x` aesthetic inside `aes()`.
- Used to change appearance of the bars with `color`, `fill`, `alpha` arguments.

### **`geom_density()`**

- Dedicated to change the appearance of the curve with `size`, `col`, `lty` arguments.

## Scatterplot

&gt; A **scatterplot** aims to understand the nature of relationship between two dependant variables.


### **`geom_point()`**

- Requires to specify data `data()`.
- Requires the `x` and `y` aesthetic inside `aes()`.

### **`geom_smooth()`**

- Draws a smoothing line (based on loess) by default, can be tweaked to draw the line of best fit by setting `method='lm'`.

## Correlation matrix

&gt; A **correlation matrix** is simply a table that displays the correlation coefficients for different numerix variables. The matrix depicts the correlation between all the possible pairs of values in a table. It is a powerful tool to summarize a large dataset and to identify and visualize patterns in the given data. 

### **`corr()`**

- Calculates the correlation between two variables.
